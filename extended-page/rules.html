    <h1>Upsilon GDPS Platformer List Rules</h1>
    <p>The Upsilon GDPS Platformer List is designed to maintain a fair and consistent environment for players submitting completions or trying to get new levels added to the list. The rules below outline the conditions under which a submission will be accepted or denied. These guidelines are updated regularly, so make sure to review them often.</p>
    <p>If you need help or clarification, feel free to ask a member of the Demonlist Team. You can join the official UGDPS <a class="link" href="https://discord.gg/cY8jBwKZkM">Discord Server</a> and visit <b>#🗃︲list-support</b> for assistance.</p>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Record Submission Rules (Cross-Platform)</h2>
    <p>These rules apply to ALL platforms unless otherwise specified.</p>
    <li><b style="color:#ff4a4a;">A complete, uncut 0–100 run</b> must be provided. If your main upload contains cuts, the raw footage MUST include the entire run with no interruptions.</li>
    <li>After 2025, December 7th, Raw Footage is not required. But maybe if the level is hard, this is required.  
Also, the link should be shareable Google Drive link. We'll inspect the your completion if there's something suspicious. (Raw Footage will be kept private.)</li>
    <li>You must show a reasonable number of previous attempts. For example, only dying once at 1% is not enough to prove legitimate progression. Everplay submissions are the only exception.</li>
    <li><b>Endscreen stats must be fully visible</b> (the entire box) for at least one frame.</li>
    <li>If your mod menu supports a cheat indicator (such as Megahack v9, Eclipse or else.), it must be turned on and visible.</li>
    <li><b style="color:#ff4a4a;">Clicks are required</b> for all completions. Clicks must be consistent, audible, and match the onscreen actions.</li>
    <li>Refer to <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1evE4nXATxRAQWu2Ajs54E6cVUqHBoSid8I7JauJnOzg/">this sheet</a> for the full list of approved mods.</li>
    <li>You must beat the correct version of the level. Verify the level ID on the Platformer List page before submitting. (LDM is allowed.)</li>
    <li>No secret routes, no bug routes, and no exploits that noticeably change the intended difficulty.</li>
    <li>No easy mode versions or modified copies of the level. Only the official published level is accepted.</li>
    <li>Platformer completions are not allowed for Platformer List records.</li>
    <li>Noclip accuracy runs are not accepted.</li>
    <li>CBF (Click Between Frames) is allowed, but physics bypass is NOT. TPS bypass is allowed up to a maximum of 240 TPS.</li>
    <li>FPS Bypass is allowed up to a maximum of 360 FPS.</li>
    <li>When a level moves to the Legacy List, new records for that level will no longer be accepted.</li>
    <br>

    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Record Submission Rules (Mobile)</h2>
    <p>Mobile players must also follow every rule listed above, with additional requirements to ensure legitimacy.</p>
    <li><b>Visual taps are required.</b> Your finger inputs must be clearly visible on the screen.   If there's no visual taps, audible taps are required.</li>
    <br>

    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Level Rules</h2>
    <p>These requirements must be met for a level to be considered for the UGDPS Platformer List.</p>
    <li>The level must be at least <b>30 seconds long</b> and rated <b>Hard Demon or higher</b> by the UGDPS moderators.</li>
    <li>No crash triggers may be used. Any level containing crash triggers will be automatically denied.</li>
    <li>If Random Triggers are used, the editor MUST clearly explain how the randomization works for transparency.</li>
